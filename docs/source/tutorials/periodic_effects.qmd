A common practice in time series forecasting is featuring periodic effects such as day of the week or weekend effects. `pyrenew` has built-in functions and classes to incorporate such effects into renewal models. Notably, the `arrayutils.PeriodicBroadcaster` class.

This document demonstrates how to use these functions and classes to model periodic effects and broadcasting in renewal models: Repeating elements of a sequence and repeating a sequence as a whole (tiling).

## Repeated units

The `RtPeriodicDiff` and `RtWeeklyDiff` classes use `PeriodicBroadcaster` to repeat each vector element to represent Rt values held constant within a period. Let's show it's usage with a basic renewal model. We will use the same model structure shown in the `getting_started` tutorial:

```{python}
# | label: loading-pkgs
# | output: false
# | warning: false
import jax.numpy as jnp
import numpy as np
import numpyro
from pyrenew import process, deterministic
```

```{python}
# The random process for Rt
rt_proc = process.RtPeriodicDiffARProcess(
    name="rt_weekly_diff",
    offset=0,
    period_size=7,
    log_rt_init_rv=deterministic.DeterministicVariable(
        name="log_rt", value=jnp.array([0.1, 0.2])
    ),
    autoreg_rv=deterministic.DeterministicVariable(
        name="autoreg", value=jnp.array([0.7])
    ),
    periodic_diff_sd_rv=deterministic.DeterministicVariable(
        name="periodic_diff_sd", value=jnp.array([0.1])
    ),
)
```

```{python}
with numpyro.handlers.seed(rng_seed=20):
    sim_data = rt_proc(duration=30)

# Plotting the Rt values
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.step(np.arange(len(sim_data.rt.value)), sim_data.rt.value, where="post")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Rt")
plt.title("Simulated Rt values")

# Adding bands to mark weeks
for i in range(0, 30, 7):
    plt.axvline(i, color="black", linestyle="--", alpha=0.5)
plt.show()
```

The implementation of the `RtPeriodicDiffARProcess` uses `repeat_until_n` to repeating values: `repeat_until_n(..., period_size=7)`. The `RtWeeklyDiff` class is a particular case of `RtPeriodicDiff` with a period size of seven.

## Repeated sequences (tiling)

The `PeriodicBroadcaster` class can also be used to repeat a sequence as a whole. For example, we can use this to model a periodic effect such as day-of-the-week effect. Let's use the `DayOfWeekEffect` random variable. We will sample from a scaled Dirchlet distribution such that the sum of the samples is 7:

```{python}
import numpyro.distributions as dist
from pyrenew import transformation, randomvariable

# Building the transformed prior: Dirichlet * 7
mysimplex = dist.TransformedDistribution(
    dist.Dirichlet(concentration=jnp.ones(7)),
    transformation.AffineTransform(loc=0, scale=7.0),
)

# Constructing the day of week effect
dayofweek = process.DayOfWeekEffect(
    offset=0,
    quantity_to_broadcast=randomvariable.DistributionalVariable(
        name="simp", distribution=mysimplex
    ),
    t_start=0,
)
```

Like before, we can use the `sample` method to generate samples from the day of week effect:

```{python}
with numpyro.handlers.seed(rng_seed=20):
    sim_data = dayofweek(duration=30)

# Plotting the effect values
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.step(
    np.arange(len(sim_data.value.value)), sim_data.value.value, where="post"
)
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Effect size")
plt.title("Simulated Day of Week Effect values")

# Adding bands to mark weeks
for i in range(0, 30, 7):
    plt.axvline(i, color="black", linestyle="--", alpha=0.5)
plt.show()
```

Like the example from the previous section, the `DayOfWeekEffect` class uses `PeriodicBroadcaster` to broadcast the data, this time using `broadcast_type = "tile"`, repeating the sequence as a whole. The `DayOfWeekEffect` class is a particular case of `PeriodicEffect` with a period size of seven.
