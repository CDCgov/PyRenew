`pyrenew` is a flexible tool for simulating and making statistical inference of epidemiological models, emphasizing renewal models. Built on `numpyro`, `pyrenew` provides core components for model building and pre-defined models for processing various observational processes. This document illustrates how `pyrenew` can be used to build a basic renewal model.

## The fundamentals

`pyrenew`'s core components are the metaclasses `RandomVariable` and `Model`. From the package's perspective, a `RandomVariable` is a quantity models can sample and estimate, **including deterministic quantities**. Mainly, sampling from a `RandomVariable` involves calling the `sample()` method. The benefit of this design is the definition of the sample function can be arbitrary, allowing the user to either sample from a distribution using `numpyro.sample()`, compute fixed quantities (like a mechanistic equation), or return a fixed value (like a pre-computed PMF.) For instance, we may be interested in estimating a PMF, in which case a `RandomVariable` sampling function may roughly be defined as:

```python
class MyRandVar(RandomVariable):
    def sample(...) -> ArrayLike:
        return numpyro.sample(...)
```

Whereas, in some other cases, we may instead use a fixed quantity for that variable (like a pre-computed PMF), where the `RandomVariable`'s sample function could be defined like:

```python
class MyRandVar(RandomVariable):
    def sample(...) -> ArrayLike:
        return jax.numpy.array([0.2, 0.7, 0.1])
```

This way, when a `Model` samples from `MyRandVar`, it could be either adding random variables to be estimated (first case) or just retrieving some quantity needed for other calculations (second case.)

The `Model` metaclass provides basic functionality for estimating and simulation. Like `RandomVariable`, the `Model` metaclass has a `sample()` method that defines the model structure. Ultimately, models can be nested (or inherited), providing a straightforward way to add layers of complexity.


## 'Hello world' model

This section will show the steps to build a simple renewal model featuring a latent infection process, a random walk Rt process, and an observation process for the reported infections. We start by loading the needed components to build a basic renewal model:

```{python}
#| label: loading-pkgs
#| output: false
#| warning: false
import jax.numpy as jnp
import numpy as np
import numpyro as npro
import numpyro.distributions as dist
from pyrenew.process import RtRandomWalkProcess
from pyrenew.latent import Infections, Infections0
from pyrenew.observation import PoissonObservation
from pyrenew.deterministic import DeterministicPMF
from pyrenew.model import RtInfectionsRenewalModel
```

The basic renewal model defines five components: generation interval, initial infections, Rt, latent infections, and observed infections. In this example, the generation interval is not estimated but passed as a deterministic instance of `RandomVariable`. Here is the code to initialize the five components:

```{python}
#| label: creating-elements
# (1) The generation interval (deterministic)
gen_int = DeterministicPMF(jnp.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]))

# (2) Initial infections (inferred with a prior)
I0 = Infections0(I0_dist=dist.LogNormal(0, 1))

# (3) The random process for Rt
rt_proc = RtRandomWalkProcess()

# (4) Latent infection process (which will use 1 and 2)
latent_infections = Infections()

# (5) The observed infections process (with mean at the latent infections)
observed_infections = PoissonObservation()
```

With these five pieces, we can build the basic renewal model:

```{python}
#| label: model-creation
model1 = RtInfectionsRenewalModel(
    gen_int             = gen_int,
    I0                  = I0,
    Rt_process          = rt_proc,
    latent_infections   = latent_infections,
    observed_infections = observed_infections,
    )
```

The following diagram summarizes how the modules interact via composition; notably, `gen_int`, `I0`, `rt_proc`, `latent_infections`, and `observed_infections` are instances of `RandomVariable`, which means these can be easily replaced to generate a different version of `RtInfectionsRenewalModel`:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: overview-of-RtInfectionsRenewalModel
flowchart TB
    genint["(1) gen_int\n(DetermnisticPMF)"]
    i0["(2) I0\n(Infections0)"]
    rt["(3) rt_proc\n(RtRandomWalkProcess)"]
    inf["(4) latent_infections\n(Infections)"]
    obs["(5) observed_infections\n(PoissonObservation)"]

    model1["model1\n(RtInfectionsRenewalModel)"]

    i0-->|Composes|model1
    genint-->|Composes|model1
    rt-->|Composes|model1
    obs-->|Composes|model1
    inf-->|Composes|model1
```

Using `numpyro`, we can simulate data using the `sample()` member function of `RtInfectionsRenewalModel`:

```{python}
#| label: simulate
np.random.seed(223)
with npro.handlers.seed(rng_seed = np.random.randint(1, 60)):
    sim_data = model1.sample(n_timepoints=30)

sim_data
```

The `sample()` method of the `RtInfectionsRenewalModel` returns a list composed of the `Rt` and `infections` sequences.

```{python}
#| label: basic-fig
#| fig-cap: Rt and Infections
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)

# Rt plot
axs[0].plot(range(0, 31), sim_data[0])
axs[0].set_ylabel('Rt')

# Infections plot
axs[1].plot(range(0, 31), sim_data[1])
axs[1].set_ylabel('Infections')

fig.suptitle('Basic renewal model')
fig.supxlabel('Time')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

To fit the model, we can use the `run()` method of the model `RtInfectionsRenewalModel`; an inherited method from the metaclass `Model`:

```{python}
#| label: model-fit
import jax

model1.run(
    num_warmup=2000,
    num_samples=1000,
    observed_infections=sim_data.observed,
    n_timepoints = len(sim_data[1])-1,
    rng_key=jax.random.PRNGKey(54),
    mcmc_args=dict(progress_bar=False),
    )
```

Now, let's investigate the output, particularly the posterior distribution of the Rt estimates:

```{python}
#| label: output-rt
#| fig-cap: Rt posterior distribution
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
import polars as pl
samps = model1.spread_draws([('Rt', 'time')])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=[4, 5])

ax.plot(sim_data[0])
samp_ids = np.random.randint(size=25, low=0, high=999)
for samp_id in samp_ids:
    sub_samps = samps.filter(pl.col("draw") == samp_id).sort(pl.col('time'))
    ax.plot(sub_samps.select("time").to_numpy(),
            sub_samps.select("Rt").to_numpy(), color="darkblue", alpha=0.1)
ax.set_ylim([0.4, 1/.4])
ax.set_yticks([0.5, 1, 2])
ax.set_yscale("log")
```

## Architecture of pyrenew

`pyrenew` leverages `numpyro`'s flexibility to build models via composition. As a principle, most objects in `pyrenew` can be treated as random variables we can sample. At the top-level `pyrenew` has two metaclass from which most objects inherit: `RandomVariable` and `Model`. From them, the following four sub-modules arise:

-   The `process` sub-module,
-   The `deterministic` sub-module,
-   The `observation` sub-module,
-   The `latent` sub-module, and
-   The `models` sub-module

The first four are collections of instances of `RandomVariable`, and the last is a collection of instances of `Model`. The following diagram shows a detailed view of how meta classes, modules, and classes interact to create the `RtInfectionsRenewalModel` instantiated in the previous section:

```{mermaid}

    rand((RandomVariable\nmetaclass))
    models((Model\nmetaclass))

        obs["observed_infections\n(PoissonObservation)"]
    end

    subgraph latent[Latent module]
        inf["latent_infections\n(Infections)"]
        i0["I0\n(Infections0)"]

    end

    subgraph model[Model module]

    end
