`pyrenew` is a flexible tool for simulating and making statistical inferences from epidemiologic models, with an emphasis on renewal models. Built on `numpyro`, `pyrenew` provides core components for model building and pre-defined models for processing various observational processes. This document illustrates how `pyrenew` can be used to build a basic renewal model.

## The fundamentals

`pyrenew`'s core components are the metaclasses `RandomVariable` and `Model` (in Python, a _metaclass_ is a class whose instances are also classes, where a _class_ is a template for making objects). Within the `pyrenew` package, a `RandomVariable` is a quantity that models can estimate and sample from, **including deterministic quantities**. The benefit of this design is that the definition of the `sample()` function can be arbitrary, allowing the user to either sample from a distribution using `numpyro.sample()`, compute fixed quantities (like a mechanistic equation), or return a fixed value (like a pre-computed PMF.) For instance, when estimating a PMF, the `RandomVariable` sampling function may roughly be defined as:

```python
# define a new class called MyRandVar that inherits from the RandomVariable class
class MyRandVar(RandomVariable):
    #define a method called sample that returns an object of type ArrayLike
    def sample(...) -> ArrayLike:
        # calls sample function from NumPyro package
        return numpyro.sample(...)
```

Whereas,  in some other cases, we may instead use a fixed quantity for that variable (like a pre-computed PMF), where the `RandomVariable`'s sample function could instead be defined as:

```python
# instead define MyRandVar to still inherit from the RandVariable class
class MyRandVar(RandomVariable):
    #define sample method that still returns an ArrayLike object
    def sample(...) -> ArrayLike:
        #sampling method is a pre-computed PMF, a JAX NumPy array with explicit elements
        return jax.numpy.array([0.2, 0.7, 0.1])
```

Thus, when a `Model` samples from `MyRandVar`, it could be either adding random variables to be estimated (first case) or just retrieving some quantity needed for other calculations (second case.)

The `Model` metaclass provides basic functionality for estimating and simulation. Like `RandomVariable`, the `Model` metaclass has a `sample()` method that defines the model structure. Ultimately, models can be nested (or inherited), providing a straightforward way to add layers of complexity.


## 'Hello world' model

This section will show the steps to build a simple renewal model featuring a latent infection process, a random walk Rt process, and an observation process for the reported infections.

We start by loading the needed components to build a basic renewal model:

```{python}
#| label: loading-pkgs
#| output: false
#| warning: false
import jax.numpy as jnp
import numpy as np
import numpyro as npro
import numpyro.distributions as dist
from pyrenew.process import RtRandomWalkProcess
from pyrenew.latent import Infections, Infections0
from pyrenew.observation import PoissonObservation
from pyrenew.deterministic import DeterministicPMF
from pyrenew.model import RtInfectionsRenewalModel
```

The pyrenew package models the real-time reproductive number $R_t$, the ratio of new infections at time $t$ to previous infections at some time $t-s$, as a renewal process model. Our basic renewal process model defines five components:

(1) generation interval, the times between infections

(2) initial infections, occurring prior to time $t = 0$

(3) $R_t$, the real-time reproductive number,

(4) latent infections, i.e., those infections which are known to exist but are not observed (or not observable), and

(5) observed infections, a subset of underlying true infections that are reported, perhaps via hospital admissions, physician's office visits, or routine biosurveillance.

To initialize these five components within the renewal modeling framework, we estimate each component with:

(1) In this example, the generation interval is not estimated but passed as a deterministic instance of `RandomVariable`

(2) an instance of the `Infections0` class, with a log-normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1 as input

(3) an instance of the `RtRandomWalkProcess` class with default values

(4) an instance of the `Infections` class with default values, and

(5) an instance of the `PoissonObservation` class with default values

```{python}
#| label: creating-elements
# (1) The generation interval (deterministic)
gen_int = DeterministicPMF(
    (jnp.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]),),
)

# (2) Initial infections (inferred with a prior)
I0 = Infections0(I0_dist=dist.LogNormal(0, 1))

# (3) The random process for Rt
rt_proc = RtRandomWalkProcess()

# (4) Latent infection process (which will use 1 and 2)
latent_infections = Infections()

# (5) The observed infections process (with mean at the latent infections)
observed_infections = PoissonObservation()
```

With these five pieces, we can build the basic renewal model:

```{python}
#| label: model-creation
model1 = RtInfectionsRenewalModel(
    gen_int             = gen_int,
    I0                  = I0,
    Rt_process          = rt_proc,
    latent_infections   = latent_infections,
    observed_infections = observed_infections,
    )
```

The following diagram summarizes how the modules interact via composition; notably, `gen_int`, `I0`, `rt_proc`, `latent_infections`, and `observed_infections` are instances of `RandomVariable`, which means these can be easily replaced to generate a different version of `RtInfectionsRenewalModel`:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: overview-of-RtInfectionsRenewalModel
flowchart TB
    genint["(1) gen_int\n(DetermnisticPMF)"]
    i0["(2) I0\n(Infections0)"]
    rt["(3) rt_proc\n(RtRandomWalkProcess)"]
    inf["(4) latent_infections\n(Infections)"]
    obs["(5) observed_infections\n(PoissonObservation)"]

    model1["model1\n(RtInfectionsRenewalModel)"]

    i0-->|Composes|model1
    genint-->|Composes|model1
    rt-->|Composes|model1
    obs-->|Composes|model1
    inf-->|Composes|model1
```

Using `numpyro`, we can simulate data using the `sample()` member function of `RtInfectionsRenewalModel`:

```{python}
#| label: simulate
np.random.seed(223)
with npro.handlers.seed(rng_seed = np.random.randint(1, 60)):
    sim_data = model1.sample(n_timepoints=30)

sim_data
```

The `sample()` method of the `RtInfectionsRenewalModel` returns a list composed of the `Rt` and `infections` sequences.

```{python}
#| label: basic-fig
#| fig-cap: Rt and Infections
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)

# Rt plot
axs[0].plot(range(0, 31), sim_data[0])
axs[0].set_ylabel('Rt')

# Infections plot
axs[1].plot(range(0, 31), sim_data[1])
axs[1].set_ylabel('Infections')

fig.suptitle('Basic renewal model')
fig.supxlabel('Time')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

To fit the model, we can use the `run()` method of the model `RtInfectionsRenewalModel`; an inherited method from the metaclass `Model`:

```{python}
#| label: model-fit
import jax

model1.run(
    num_warmup=2000,
    num_samples=1000,
    observed_infections=sim_data.observed,
    n_timepoints = len(sim_data[1])-1,
    rng_key=jax.random.PRNGKey(54),
    mcmc_args=dict(progress_bar=False),
    )
```

Now, let's investigate the output, particularly the posterior distribution of the Rt estimates:

```{python}
#| label: output-rt
#| fig-cap: Rt posterior distribution
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
import polars as pl
samps = model1.spread_draws([('Rt', 'time')])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=[4, 5])

ax.plot(sim_data[0])
samp_ids = np.random.randint(size=25, low=0, high=999)
for samp_id in samp_ids:
    sub_samps = samps.filter(pl.col("draw") == samp_id).sort(pl.col('time'))
    ax.plot(sub_samps.select("time").to_numpy(),
            sub_samps.select("Rt").to_numpy(), color="darkblue", alpha=0.1)
ax.set_ylim([0.4, 1/.4])
ax.set_yticks([0.5, 1, 2])
ax.set_yscale("log")
```

## Architecture of pyrenew

`pyrenew` leverages `numpyro`'s flexibility to build models via composition. As a principle, most objects in `pyrenew` can be treated as random variables we can sample. At the top-level `pyrenew` has two metaclass from which most objects inherit: `RandomVariable` and `Model`. From them, the following four sub-modules arise:

-   The `process` sub-module,
-   The `deterministic` sub-module,
-   The `observation` sub-module,
-   The `latent` sub-module, and
-   The `models` sub-module

The first four are collections of instances of `RandomVariable`, and the last is a collection of instances of `Model`. The following diagram shows a detailed view of how meta classes, modules, and classes interact to create the `RtInfectionsRenewalModel` instantiated in the previous section:

```{mermaid}
