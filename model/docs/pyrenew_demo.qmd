title: Pyrenew demo
format: gfm
engine: jupyter
---

This demo simulates a basic renewal process data and then fits it using `pyrenew`.

Youâ€™ll need to install `pyrenew` using either poetry or pip. To install `pyrenew` using poetry, run the following command from within the directory containing the `pyrenew` project:

```bash
poetry install
```

To install `pyrenew` using pip, run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CDCgov/multisignal-epi-inference@main#subdirectory=model
```

To begin, run the following import section to call external modules and functions necessary to run the `pyrenew` demo. The `import` statement imports the module and the `as` statement renames the module for use within this script. The `from` statement imports a specific function from a module (named after the `.`) within a package (named before the `.`).

```{python}
# | output: false
# | label: loading-pkgs
# | warning: false
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import numpy as np
from numpyro.handlers import seed
import numpyro.distributions as dist
```

```{python}
from pyrenew.process import SimpleRandomWalkProcess
```

To understand the simple random walk process underlying the sampling within the renewal process model, we first examine a single random walk path. Using the `sample` method from an instance of the `SimpleRandomWalkProcess` class, we first create an instance of the `SimpleRandomWalkProcess` class with a normal distribution of mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0.0001 as its input. Next, the `with` statement sets the seed for the random number generator for the n_timepoints of the block that follows. Inside the `with` block, the `q_samp = q.sample(n_timepoints=100)` generates the sample instance over a n_timepoints of 100 time units. Finally, this single random walk process is visualized using `matplot.pyplot` to plot the exponential of the sample instance.

```{python}
# | label: fig-randwalk
# | fig-cap: Random walk example
np.random.seed(3312)
q = SimpleRandomWalkProcess(dist.Normal(0, 0.001))
with seed(rng_seed=np.random.randint(0, 1000)):
    q_samp = q.sample(n_timepoints=100)

plt.plot(np.exp(q_samp[0]))
```

Next, import several additional functions from the `latent` module of the `pyrenew` package to model infections and hospital admissions.

```{python}
from pyrenew.latent import (
    Infections,
    HospitalAdmissions,
)
from pyrenew.metaclass import DistributionalRV
```

Additionally, import several classes from Pyrenew, including a Poisson observation process, determininstic PMF and variable classes, the Pyrenew hospitalization model, and a renewal model (Rt) random walk process:

```{python}
from pyrenew.observation import PoissonObservation
from pyrenew.deterministic import DeterministicPMF, DeterministicVariable
from pyrenew.model import HospitalAdmissionsModel
from pyrenew.process import RtRandomWalkProcess
from pyrenew.latent import InfectionSeedingProcess, SeedInfectionsZeroPad
import pyrenew.transformation as t
```

To initialize the model, we first define initial conditions, including:

1) deterministic generation time, defined as an instance of the `DeterministicPMF` class, which gives the probability of each possible outcome for a discrete random variable given as a JAX NumPy array of four possible outcomes

2) initial infections at the start of the renewal process as a log-normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. Infections before this time are assumed to be 0.

3) latent infections as an instance of the `Infections` class with default settings

4) latent hospitalization process, modeled by first defining the time interval from infections to hospitalizations as a `DeterministicPMF` input with 18 possible outcomes and corresponding probabilities given by the values in the array. The `HospitalAdmissions` function then takes in this defined time interval, as well as defining the rate at which infections are admitted to the hospital due to infection, modeled as a log-normal distribution with mean = `jnp.log(0.05)` and standard deviation = 0.05.

5) hospitalization observation process, modeled with a  Poisson distribution

6) an Rt random walk process with default settings

```{python}
# Initializing model components:

# 1) A deterministic generation time
pmf_array = jnp.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])
gen_int = DeterministicPMF(pmf_array, name="gen_int")

# 2) Initial infections
I0 = InfectionSeedingProcess(
    "I0_seeding",
    DistributionalRV(dist=dist.LogNormal(0, 1), name="I0"),
    SeedInfectionsZeroPad(pmf_array.size),
)

# 3) The latent infections process
latent_infections = Infections()

# 4) The latent hospitalization process:

# First, define a deterministic infection to hosp pmf
inf_hosp_int = DeterministicPMF(
    jnp.array(
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05]
    ),
    name="inf_hosp_int",
)

latent_admissions = HospitalAdmissions(
    infection_to_admission_interval_rv=inf_hosp_int,
    infect_hosp_rate_rv=DistributionalRV(
        dist=dist.LogNormal(jnp.log(0.05), 0.05), name="IHR"
    ),
)

# 5) An observation process for the hospital admissions
admissions_process = PoissonObservation()

# 6) A random walk process (it could be deterministic using
# pyrenew.process.DeterministicProcess())
Rt_process = RtRandomWalkProcess(
    Rt0_dist = dist.TruncatedNormal(loc=1.2, scale=0.2, low=0),
    Rt_transform = t.ExpTransform().inv,
    Rt_rw_dist = dist.Normal(0, 0.025),
)
```

The `HospitalAdmissionsModel` is then initialized using the initial conditions just defined:

```{python}
# Initializing the model
hospmodel = HospitalAdmissionsModel(
    gen_int_rv=gen_int,
    I0_rv=I0,
    latent_hosp_admissions_rv=latent_admissions,
    hosp_admission_obs_process_rv=admissions_process,
    latent_infections_rv=latent_infections,
    Rt_process_rv=Rt_process,
)
```

Next, we sample from the `hospmodel` for 30 time steps and view the output of a single run:

```{python}
with seed(rng_seed=np.random.randint(1, 60)):
    x = hospmodel.sample(n_timepoints_to_simulate=30)
x
```

Visualizations of the single model output show (top) infections over the 30 time steps, (middle) hospital admissions over the 30 time steps, and (bottom)

```{python}
# | label: fig-hosp
# | fig-cap: Infections
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=3, sharex=True)
ax[0].plot(x.latent_infections)
ax[0].set_ylim([1 / 5, 5])
ax[1].plot(x.latent_hosp_admissions)
ax[2].plot(x.observed_hosp_admissions, "o")
for axis in ax[:-1]:
    axis.set_yscale("log")
```

To fit the `hospmodel` to the simulated data, we call `hospmodel.run()`, an MCMC algorithm, with the arguments generated in `hospmodel` object, using 1000 warmup stepts and 1000 samples to draw from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The model is run for `len(x.sampled)-1` time steps with the seed set by `jax.random.PRNGKey()`

```{python}
# from numpyro.infer import MCMC, NUTS
hospmodel.run(
    num_warmup=1000,
    num_samples=1000,
    data_observed_hosp_admissions=x.observed_hosp_admissions,
    rng_key=jax.random.PRNGKey(54),
    mcmc_args=dict(progress_bar=False),
)
```

Print a summary of the model:

```{python}
hospmodel.print_summary()
```

Next, we will use the `spread_draws` function from the `pyrenew.mcmcutils` module to process the MCMC samples. The `spread_draws` function reformats the samples drawn from the `mcmc.get_samples()` from the `hospmodel`. The samples are simulated Rt values over time.

```{python}
from pyrenew.mcmcutils import spread_draws

samps = spread_draws(hospmodel.mcmc.get_samples(), [("Rt", "time")])
```

We visualize these samples below, with individual possible Rt estimates over time shown in light blue, and the overall mean estimate Rt shown in dark blue.

```{python}
# | label: fig-sampled-rt
# | fig-cap: Posterior Rt
import numpy as np
import polars as pl

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=[4, 5])

ax.plot(x[0])
samp_ids = np.random.randint(size=25, low=0, high=999)
for samp_id in samp_ids:
    sub_samps = samps.filter(pl.col("draw") == samp_id).sort(pl.col("time"))
    ax.plot(
        sub_samps.select("time").to_numpy(),
        sub_samps.select("Rt").to_numpy(),
        color="darkblue",
        alpha=0.1,
    )
ax.set_ylim([0.4, 1 / 0.4])
ax.set_yticks([0.5, 1, 2])
ax.set_yscale("log")
```
