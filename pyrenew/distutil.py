    """
    Validate that a vector represents a discrete
    probability distribution to within a specified
    tolerance, raising a ValueError if not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    discrete_dist
        An jax array containing non-negative values that
        represent a discrete probability distribution. The values
        must sum to 1 within the specified tolerance.
    tol
        The tolerance within which the sum of the distribution must
        be 1. Defaults to 1e-5.

    Returns
    -------
    ArrayLike
        The normalized distribution array if the input is valid.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any value in discrete_dist is negative or if the sum of the
        distribution does not equal 1 within the specified tolerance.
